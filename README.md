# Checkout Shopping list [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/raulh82vlc/ShoppingList.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/raulh82vlc/ShoppingList)
Checkout shopping list shows a list of product which can be added to the basket and making checkout with their discounts

This project uses Material design with *Clean architecture* by means of *Model-View-Presenter (MVP)* with *Repository pattern*
as well as `Dagger 2` for *Dependency Injection*, trying to respect *SOLID principles* as much as possible.

## Overview
At this open-source project, it is decoupled between `android` and `domain` modules or high level layers.

This means, `android` is strongly coupled with the Android framework and `domain` is decoupled from it, and can be re-used for other purposes when
required as is purely *Java* based, but not framework coupled.

Inside the those modules, there are some good practices being employed, for instance:
- There is an implementation of the *repository pattern* with a Network datasource (it could be extended to have others if required such as InternetDataSource and so on).

*Retrofit 2* is the Network library which uses *OkHttp* as its client, this makes calls to the API, transforming the responses to models, for this purpose and properly handling
the different requests on background threads with a pool of threads which passes their use cases result and avoids to lock the
UI thread.

## Architecture design overview
The exchange between the different *layers* is as follows:
- **Repository layer**:
  - from the models coming from a concrete *data source* to the *Repository* (repository is the responsible of managing from 1 to n datasources, in this case only network datasource)
  - from the *Repository* to their associated *Interactor* (or use case)
  - this *Repository* contains cached information for the shopping list content in RAM memory, being part of its implementation
- **Interactor layer**: from the *Interactor*, which is responsible of the *business logic* and communicating results to the *Presenter*
- **Presenter layer**: from the *Presenter*, which provides the final formatted info to a passive `View` from a UI element (fragments / activities).
Finally, this information would be passed through the UI thread.


### Material design
- This code test uses a wide range of Material design widgets from the Design support library such as:
- `AppBarLayout`, `CoordinatorLayout`, `Toolbar`, `RecyclerView` as well as Material theme styles.

### Features
- At the main screen a list of products which can be bought with their code, name and price
- Once clicked an item, the product is added to the list, and a toast is shown if correctly added
- For *checking out* and seeing the total basket price, click on the FAB button, this provides a final amount with discounts on it
- The *repository* contains cached information (RAM) for making an easy check out of the shopping list at any time
- For *removing* a previous shopping list (cached one), you need to entirely close the app, then the cache is clean
- Error handling integrated for `Http` or `Connection` or `IO` issues, also empty state indicating no results when required.
- A Loader is placed each time a new request is started, to indicate the user the fact that there is an action going on
- There is a small amount of Unit test cases for the most critical parts: mainly the strategy for discounts as well as repository applying of its strategy (unit tests).
- Discount 1: Applied in **2-for-1** promotions (buy two of the same product, get one free), and would like for there to be a 2-for-1 special on VOUCHER items.
- Discount 2: For bulk purchases (buying x or more of a product, the price of that product is reduced), and demands that if you buy **3 or more** TSHIRT items, the price per unit should be 19.00â‚¬.
